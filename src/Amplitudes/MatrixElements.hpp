  @brief Which frequency the operator, or the RPA, is evaluated at.
  @details
  There is no obvious default: the right choice depends on the calculation,
  so it must be given explicitly.

  - `transition`: the driver sets the frequency itself, to each pair's own
    transition frequency \f$ \omega_{ab} = \en_a - \en_b \f$. The operator is
    updated (h at \f$ +|\omega_{ab}| \f$, h_minus at \f$ -|\omega_{ab}| \f$),
    and the RPA is re-solved, at every element. This is the physically
    correct frequency for a transition.

  - `fixed`: the driver does not touch the frequency. The operator is assumed
    to already be at the intended frequency, and the RPA to already have been
    solved there, by the caller. Use for a fixed external field, or to
    reproduce a fixed-frequency calculation.

  @brief Matrix elements of h for all allowed pairs from two lists of

  @details
  Calculates \f$ \redmatel{a}{h}{b} \f$ for each pair allowed by the
  selection rules, with the bra states taken from @p a_orbs and the ket
  states from @p b_orbs, diagonal first, then off-diagonal.

  Selection rules: pairs with isZero() are skipped; diagonal elements only
  for even-parity operators.

  When @p a_orbs and @p b_orbs are the same list (as in the single-list
  overload below), each pair is calculated once: for odd-parity operators,
  only elements with the even-parity state on the right are included
  (unless calculate_both); for even-parity operators, only the upper
  triangle. Two distinct lists have no such pairing, so every pair is
  calculated and calculate_both has no effect.

  Frequency handling (see @ref Frequency): with `transition`, the operator
  is updated at each pair's transition frequency, @p h at
  \f$ +|\omega_{ab}| \f$ and @p h_minus at \f$ -|\omega_{ab}| \f$, and the
  RPA is re-solved there (cleared first when poorly converged, or when
  rpa_iterations is 1 so that first-order RPA is not iterated from a
  previous solution). With `fixed`, neither is touched: the caller must set
  the operator frequency (see @ref set_operator_frequency) and solve the
  RPA before calling.

  solved the RPA already, and the SR denominators are taken at the frequency
  it was solved at (zero if there is no RPA).
