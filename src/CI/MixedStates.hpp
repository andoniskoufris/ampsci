  momentum @p twoJ /2), \f$ K \f$ runs over the CSFs of the reference state
  \f$ \Psi_0 \f$ (solution @p i0 of @p Psi0), and \f$ c^{(0)}_K \f$ are its CI

/*!
  @brief Solves the CI mixed-states (Sternheimer) equation for a one-body
  operator.
  @details
  Finds the first-order correction to the CI state \f$ \Psi_0 \f$ (solution
  @p i0 of @p Psi0, with energy \f$ E_0 \f$) due to the one-body operator
  \f$ T^{(K)} \f$, expanded over the CSFs of a single (J, parity) sector:

  \f[
    \ket{\delta\Psi} = \sum_I c_I \ket{I; J^\pi}.
  \f]

  The coefficients solve the linear system

  \f[
    \sum_J \left[ \matel{I}{H}{J} - (E_0 + \omega) \, \delta_{IJ} \right] c_J
      = - \sum_K \redmatel{I}{T^{(K)}}{K} \, c^{(0)}_K,
  \f]

  where \f$ H \f$ is the CI Hamiltonian in the sector defined by @p target
  (given as the matrix @p Hci, e.g., from @ref construct_Hci), and the
  right-hand side is formed by @ref TPsi_reduced.

  Since the right-hand side is reduced (in \f$ T \f$), so is the solution: for
  any CI state \f$ A \f$ in the same sector, the mixed state satisfies

  \f[
    \sum_I c^A_I \, c_I
      = \frac{\redmatel{A}{T^{(K)}}{\Psi_0}}{E_0 + \omega - E_A},
  \f]

  i.e., it is the sum over the entire spectrum of that sector, without the need
  to find (or sum over) the individual CI solutions.

  There is a single solution: it is returned as a @ref PsiJPi holding one
  "solution", the coefficients \f$ c_I \f$. The stored energy is \f$ E_0 \f$,
  the energy of the reference state (not an eigenvalue).

  @param Psi0    CI solutions containing the reference state.
  @param i0      Index of the reference solution within @p Psi0.
  @param target  Defines the sector the mixed state lives in (2J, parity, and
                 CSF list); its solutions, if any, are not used.
  @param Hci     CI Hamiltonian matrix in the CSF basis of @p target.
  @param h       Table of single-particle reduced matrix elements of T.
  @param K_rank  Rank of the tensor operator T.
  @param omega   Frequency: the mixed state due to a time-dependent operator,
                 \f$ T e^{-i\omega t} \f$, has denominators
                 \f$ E_0 + \omega - E_A \f$ [0].
  @return PsiJPi for the @p target sector, holding the single mixed state.
  @see project_out, to remove individual levels from the mixed state.

  @note If @p target has the same J and parity as @p Psi0, and
        \f$ \omega = 0 \f$, the matrix on the left is singular, since
        \f$ \Psi_0 \f$ itself has zero eigenvalue. In that case,
        \f$ \Psi_0 \f$ is projected out (equivalent to subtracting
        \f$ \redmatel{\Psi_0}{T}{\Psi_0} \f$ from the right-hand side).

  @note Any other state degenerate with \f$ E_0 + \omega \f$ also makes the
        system singular. Its term in the sum over states is divergent, and must
        be dealt with separately, as in degenerate perturbation theory.

  @note If the operator cannot connect the two sectors (triangle rule or
        parity), the right-hand side vanishes, and the mixed state is zero.

  @brief Removes CI levels from a mixed state, so that it is orthogonal to them.
  @details
  A mixed state is implicitly a sum over the entire spectrum of its (J, parity):

  \f[
    \ket{\delta\Psi} = \sum_A \ket{A}
      \frac{\redmatel{A}{T^{(K)}}{\Psi_0}}{E_0 + \omega - E_A}.
  \f]

  Subtracting the projection onto the listed levels removes exactly their terms
  from that sum, so they may be treated separately (e.g., with experimental
  energies or matrix elements).

  @param dPsi    Mixed state, from @ref solve_mixed_state (taken by value).
  @param levels  Solved CI levels of the same (J, parity): the eigenstates of
                 the CI Hamiltonian used for the mixed state.
  @param indices Which solutions of @p levels to remove.
  @return The mixed state, orthogonal to the listed levels.

  @note Removing a level degenerate with \f$ E_0 + \omega \f$ does not help:
        the mixed state itself does not exist in that case (see
        @ref solve_mixed_state).
