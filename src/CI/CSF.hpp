  @brief Two-electron configuration state function (CSF).
  @details
  A CSF is an antisymmetrised two-electron basis state with definite total
  angular momentum (\f$ J^2 \f$, \f$ J_z \f$) and parity, 
  built from a pair of single-particle
  relativistic orbitals.  Only two-electron CSFs are implemented.

  Each CSF2 stores the indices of its two constituent orbitals (always sorted
  to avoid double-counting) and the total parity, which is the product of the
  parities of the two single-particle states.

  @note The orbital pair is stored as a sorted array of DiracSpinor::Index
        (uint16_t) rather than DiracSpinor references, so CSF2 objects are
        cheap to copy and store. There is a limit to maximum n<=256 - see @ref Angular::nk_to_index

  @brief jj -> LS recoupling amplitude for an antisymmetrised two-electron CSF.
  @details
  Returns the amplitude of the antisymmetrised jj-coupled CSF
  \f$ |\{(n_1 l_1 j_1)(n_2 l_2 j_2)\}; J\rangle \f$ (orbitals in stored,
  i.e., sorted, order) onto the antisymmetrised LS-coupled state
  \f$ |\{(n_1 l_1)(n_2 l_2)\} L S; J\rangle \f$ of the same non-relativistic
  configuration:

    \begin{Bmatrix} l_1 & l_2 & L \\ 1/2 & 1/2 & S \\ j_1 & j_2 & J \end{Bmatrix}
  \f]

  Taken in the non-relativistic limit: the radial orbitals of
  \f$ j = l \pm 1/2 \f$ are treated as identical (overlap = 1).

  For a common non-relativistic shell (\f$ n_1 = n_2 \f$, \f$ l_1 = l_2 \f$)
  only L+S even terms exist (Pauli). When additionally \f$ j_1 \neq j_2 \f$
  the L+S odd components cancel in the antisymmetrisation and the even ones
  carry \f$ \eta = \sqrt{2} \f$; otherwise \f$ \eta = 1 \f$.
  In all cases \f$ \sum_{LS} A^2 = 1 \f$.

  @param n1,l1,twoj1  Quantum numbers of the first stored orbital.
  @param n2,l2,twoj2  Quantum numbers of the second stored orbital.
  @param L,S          Total orbital and spin angular momenta of the LS term.
  @param twoJ         Twice the total angular momentum 2J.
  @return Recoupling amplitude A(L,S); zero if forbidden.

  @note The sign convention follows the stored (sorted) orbital order; since
        nk_index sorting keeps the (n, l) order identical for all CSFs of one
        non-relativistic configuration, relative signs between such CSFs are
        consistent.

  @brief Expectation values of L^2 and S^2 for a two-electron CI state.

  Recouples each CSF to LS coupling (see @ref LS_amplitude) and accumulates,

    @brief Reads or writes CI solutions (energies, eigenvectors) to/from a multi-block binary file.
    @details
    A single file holds multiple blocks, one per (twoJ, parity) pair.
    Each block is self-describing: (twoJ, pi, num_csfs, num_solutions, E[num_csfs], M[num_csfs x num_csfs]).
    Energies and eigenvectors are always stored at full num_csfs size (zero-padded
    if only a partial solve was done), so block size is determined from num_csfs
    alone, enabling O(N) scan and in-place overwrite.

    The CSF basis (m_CSFs) is not touched; it must be constructed via the normal
    constructor before calling this function. The basis (and hence num_csfs) must
    be consistent with the file on write; a mismatch causes failure.

    ConfigInfo is not stored -- call update_config_info() after reading if needed.

    On read: scans blocks until matching (twoJ, pi) is found, verifies num_csfs,
    reads num_solutions, E, and M; returns false if block not found or num_csfs
    mismatches.

    On write: if the block already exists and num_csfs matches, overwrites it
    in-place using @ref IO::FRW::update. If it is a new block, appends it to
    the end of the file -- no rewrite of existing data.

    @note No settings are stored in the file: the filename identifies the
    calculation. The default filenames encode the settings that change the
    solutions -- see @ref CI::configuration_interaction.

    @param fname      Path to the binary file.
